        This tutorial was inspired by a talk given by <a href="https://twitter.com/waveform80">Dave Jones</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/pythonnw">Python North West</a>.
        The flights database, and much of the SQL code, is taken, with grateful thanks,
        from the <a href="https://waveform.org.uk/presentations/sql">slides</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/waveform80/presentations">source code</a> for that talk.

        Many thanks also to <a href="https://vknight.org/">Dr. Vincent Knight</a> of <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk">Cardiff University</a> for the use of his
        <a href="https://vknight.org/gt/">Game Theory Course Notes</a> and their <a href="https://github.com/drvinceknight/gt">source code</a>.
