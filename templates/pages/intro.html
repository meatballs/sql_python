  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the SQL for Python Programmers tutorial!</p>
  <p>This tutorial is designed to help Python programmers (of any level of experience) who have little or no knowledge of relational databases and SQL.</p>
  <p>If you are a database administrator or an SQL expert, you may find some tricks for how to use SQL within Python, but if you are looking for material on advanced SQL, this is probably not the place to find it.</p>

  <h2>Knowledge You Will Need</h2>
  <p>The tutorial assumes no knowledge of SQL at all and starts from the very basics. You will need some basic understanding of Python code although most of the content is suitable for Python beginners too. Where the Python code strays into more advanced concepts, there are links to the relevant documentation for you to follow.</p>
  <p>If you choose to use your own computer to run the tutorial code (details on those options are described in the <a href="/{{root}}/pages/howto">How To</a>), you will need to be comfortable using a command line terminal.</p>
